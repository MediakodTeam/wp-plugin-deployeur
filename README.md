# Deployeur, a plugin to use WordPress as a headless CMS!

## üìñ Description

This plugin is not only a simple way to deploy your WordPress website to Netlify or Vercel hosting using Webhooks.
It also empowers WordPress with features that allow users to launch a deploy only when they are ready to.

Indeed, static site generation often come with benefits of better security, better speed and lower carbon footprint.
So far we had only seen solutions that triggered a deploy each time a post was published or updated by a user.
Triggering multiple builds in a row wasn't really consistent with the spirit of designing environmentally friendly websites.

That is why we started the Deployeur's adventure!

## ü§ù Contribute
This plugin is at an early stage of its life. We have already ideas to improve it. The next one on our list will be to add a custom endpoint to manage WordPress images through ImageKit and tweak the WordPress APi to use it. It could also be considered to set user roles permissions to access the plugins settings, etc.
If you find this plugin useful, we welcome all contributions, issues and feature requests!
