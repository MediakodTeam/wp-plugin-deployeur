# Deployeur, a plugin to use WordPress as a headless CMS!

## üìñ Description

This plugin is not only a simple way to deploy your WordPress website to Netlify or Vercel hosting using Webhooks.
It also empowers WordPress with features that allow users to launch a deploy only when they are ready to.

Indeed, static site generation often come with benefits of better security, better speed and lower carbon footprint.
So far we had only seen solutions that triggered a deploy each time a post was published or updated by a user.
Triggering multiple builds in a row wasn't really consistent with the spirit of designing environmentally friendly websites.

That is why we started the Deployeur's adventure!
